# todo-fragment-app

This project was originally written in Java - as developing for Android has evolved using Kotlin and
Jetpack Compose - this repository now contains 3 branches. The application does the same on each branch -
albeit Compose may look different on the UI.

All branches compile and target to Android 15 (SDK 35)

### main branch
* kotlin + compose
### kotlin branch
* kotlin (xml layout) - edge to edge switched off (the ability to switch off may be removed in later versions - refer to Google Developer Documentation)
### java branch
* java (xml layout) - edge to edge switched off (the ability to switch off may be removed in later versions - refer to Google Developer Documentation)
